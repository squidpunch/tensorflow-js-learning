## About

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). As I read through [Gant Laborde](https://twitter.com/GantLaborde)'s [book on TensorFlow.js](https://amzn.to/3dR3vpY) I am using this as a central sandbox to work through possible solutions for the exercises.

## Available online

The current live version is hosted by on vercel at https://tensorflow-js-learning.vercel.app/
